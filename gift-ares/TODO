Essential stuff:

- timeout searches (use periodic timer and start date for each search)

- notify search manager of new sessions and resend searches until
  AS_SEARCH_SEND_COUNT is reached.

- Make file hashing non-blocking.

- Check how Ares handles same file names for downloads and do the same.
  Reverse _ARESTRA_ file appendix.

- Determine when to look for more sources for a download and start hash 
  search. Make use of pushes resulting from said search.


Optimizations:

- Optimize chunking by only allocating new chunk after the tcp connection to a
  new source has been established. Requires major rewrites, maybe we can do
  this once we use binary requests.

- Create sources from X-Alt headers and add them

- Calculate average bandwidth for sources and use faster ones during end game.
  Generally sort connection list by b/w so faster ones are always used first.

- Parse index node list packet

- Figure out how to detected firewalled search results.
  Update: There seems to be nothing in the search results.
