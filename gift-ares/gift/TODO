- Smooth upstream/downstream throttling by calling giFT's upload_throttle/download_throttle
  Clean way: Add callback to as_upload object which is used by plugin.
  Lazy way: Add #ifdef'ed throttle call directly to as_upload.c::send_file
  FIXME: Throttling should work without the above but seems not to.

- Disabled sharing makes other nodes ask us for pushes

- A lot of successfuly pushes hit the 'first packet needs 4 byte' limit in http server

- Why do we get so many push requests for unknown shares? A bug somwhere?

- Use Username@ip instead of Username@network for search results

- Source searching

- Search timeouts (in ares lib). Don't start the timeout before we have sent the search
  to at least one supernode so searches are cached when we have no connection yet.

- arlnk (Why do we need support for that in the plugin?)
