- Send proper 0x0a field in download request so we get a good position in the queue

- Handle binary push replies



- Don't add unroutable ips to node cache and remove them on connect if they are there.

- Do we have to 'switch off' hash searches when we don't want any more results?

- Is there a general limit on the number of shares we should upload like in fasttrack?

- Why do so many source go into 'timed out' state and are not removed? should they be?
  Update: I think it is giFT which times out the sources. Not sure what to do about it.

- Disabled sharing makes other nodes ask us for pushes

- Don't send shares if shares are hidden

- A lot of successfuly pushes hit the 'first packet needs 4 byte' limit in http server

- Source searching

- arlnk (Why do we need support for that in the plugin?)

- Add download throttling. Difficult due to multiple indirections through downconn
  and http server. Not very effective in general.
