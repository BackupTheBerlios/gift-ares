- Disabled sharing makes other nodes ask us for pushes

- Don't send shares if shares are hidden

- A lot of successfuly pushes hit the 'first packet needs 4 byte' limit in http server

- Source searching

- Search timeouts (in ares lib). Don't start the timeout before we have sent the search
  to at least one supernode so searches are cached when we have no connection yet.

- arlnk (Why do we need support for that in the plugin?)

- Add download throttling. Difficult due to multiple indirections through downconn
  and http server. Not very effective in general.
