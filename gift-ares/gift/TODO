- Why do so many source go into 'timed out' state and are not removed? should they be?
  Update: I think it is giFT which times out the sources. Not sure what to do about it.

- Disabled sharing makes other nodes ask us for pushes

- Don't send shares if shares are hidden

- A lot of successfuly pushes hit the 'first packet needs 4 byte' limit in http server

- Recheck if download queueing works correctly (if we advance in the queue).
  Better yet move from HTTP to binary protocol.

- Source searching

- arlnk (Why do we need support for that in the plugin?)

- Add download throttling. Difficult due to multiple indirections through downconn
  and http server. Not very effective in general.

- Why does the assert(start<end) at as_download_conn.c:376 sometimes fail?
