This is a simple file server for the Ares network.

It consists of a hashing tool (asfilehasher) which recursively hashes a
directory tree and creates a plain text file with share data.

The file server itself (asfileserver) is a daemon which reads this shares file
and simply serves up any of the files if it receives a request from an Ares
client. The shares file is reloaded on HUP.
